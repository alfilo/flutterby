    <h2>About Flutterby Plantarium</h2>
    <p>Hello!  My name is Alina.  Last year, I participated in 4-H
      and the club leaders talk a lot about community and how to
      improve our world.  So, I thought I’d like to try to help by
      encouraging people to plant flowers that produce nectar, pollen,
      and seeds to support the health and nutrition of our local
      pollinators, butterflies, and birds.</p>

    <p>By supporting bees, we help to improve our food production and
      yields.  The health of our overall butterfly and hummingbird
      population has been affected by a loss of habitat and wild
      swings in weather.  We can help the butterflies survive by
      offering them host plants and high nectar producing plants to
      support their journey.  Also, supplying high energy seeds for
      migrating songbirds and finches, will help them on their long
      journey.</p>

    <p>All funds raised will go toward buying seeds and supplies for
      next year’s plant sale.  Profits will be put towards a Community
      Action Plan, Increasing Food Security Through the Use of Vertical
      and Raised Bed Gardens, and raising money for college.  We hope
      you find something you fall in love with at this year’s Ithaca
      Spring Plant Sale!</p>
